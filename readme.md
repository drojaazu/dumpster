Dumpster
========
Dumpster is a tool for converting and dumping chunks of data inside a media image, such as a ROM dump or disk image. It is primarily a frontend for dumplib.

Dumpster and dumplib both are very much WIP! Documentation is forthcomuing.

NOTE: This project is OLD and ABANDONED. Please see the chrgfx for its spiritual successor.
